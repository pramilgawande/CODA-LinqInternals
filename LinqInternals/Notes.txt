Hi...
Welcome all!

I'm going to create an application
to use the WHERE Method of LINQ to 
filter out all the even numbers from
an integer array.

Then I'll implement the same Method
from scratch to acheieve the same outcome.

This will demonstrate what is the
internal implementation of WHERE and how it
all works together with other features
of .NET

I've created a .Net Core Console app
as you can see.

(Go to Program.cs)

Let's run the application...

We got the output as expected.

Let's understand the implementation of WHERE before begining
our implementation.

Where Implementation

public static IEnumerable<TSource> Where<TSource>
(IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource, bool> predicate)

In our case TSource is int.

Where takes an IEnumerable and a predicate which returns bool.

Predicate is nothing but a function which tests each element
of an IEnumerable for a specified condition.

In our case the condition is x % 2

Before implementing our WHERE Method let's see what are
it's main constituents.

The three main constituents or features of the C# programming
language that is necessary for the implementation of a
LINQ query are:

1. The Extension Method
2. Delegate (in our case we require Func Delegate)
3. I'll create some suspense here. ;-)

We'll discuss the third constituent at the end.

Let's now begin with our implementation of WHERE.

(Go to IEnumerableExtension.cs)
